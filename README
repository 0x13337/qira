Click on vtimeline to navigate around
Right click forks to delete them

Click on data(or doubleclick if highlightable) to follow in data
Right click on instruction address to follow in instruction


== Keyboard Shortcuts in web/client/controls.js ==

j -- next invocation of instruction
k -- prev invocation of instruction

u -- next toucher of data
i -- prev toucher of data

z -- zoom out max on vtimeline

l -- set iaddr to instruction at current clnum

== Installation on Windows (experimental) ==

Install git
Install python 2.7.8
Install pip

Run install.bat


== Using CDA ==

Pass either --cda or --cda-only to QIRA, or just call "cda binary"

The binary must have DWARF data, and the source files must exist on the system

Without cda-only, you have to go to localhost:3002/cda
Everything should be intuitive, except press '/' to regex search
